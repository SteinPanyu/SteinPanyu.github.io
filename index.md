title: "About Myself"
---

I am currently a doctoral student in [Graduate School of Data Science](https://ie.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST in Korea, supervised by [Prof. Uichin Lee](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=Sc2pBzYAAAAJ) in KAIST ICLab. I have finished the master degree in the same lab. My bachelor degree is from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/). 

I am currently interested in **machine learning for mobile affective computing**.

Feel free to drop me an email (panyu@kse.kaist.ac.kr) if you have any question!
