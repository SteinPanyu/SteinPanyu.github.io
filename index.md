I am currently a master student in [ISYSE Department](https://ie.kaist.ac.kr/) at the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology. I am supervised by [Prof. Uichin Lee](http://ic.kaist.ac.kr/wiki/wiki.cgi?UichinLee) in Kaist ICLab. My current research interest is mobile affective computing and health behavior change. 
I am about to continue with my PhD course staying in the same lab affiliated with Graduate School of Data Science in KAIST. 

I get my bachelor of enginering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).
