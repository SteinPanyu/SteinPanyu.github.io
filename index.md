I am currently a doctoral student in [Graduate School of Data Science](https://ie.kaist.ac.kr/) at the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology. I am supervised by [Prof. Uichin Lee](http://ic.kaist.ac.kr/wiki/wiki.cgi?UichinLee) in Kaist ICLab. My current research interest is machine learning for health and health behavior change. 

I got my bachelor degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).

Feel free to drop me an email (panyu@kse.kaist.ac.kr) if you have any question!
